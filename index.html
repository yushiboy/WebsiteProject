<h1 style="text-align:center">yushiboy's project website</h1>
<p>Mission statement: I would like to create a simple project website where I can host and organize personal projects.</p>
<p>In this project I feel like trying to code this in the git terminal.</p>
<p>Objectives:
<br>1) Need to figure out how to start on CSS
<br>2) Learn to create links to other pages on the site
<br>3) Add links to my github page projects
